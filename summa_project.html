    <h3>What is Summa Theologiae?</h3>
    <p>
        From Wikipedia: "The Summa Theologiae, as the <br/>
        well-known work of Thomas Aquinas, is a compendium <br/>
        of all of the main theological teachings of the <br/>
        Catholic Church, intended to be an instructional <br/>
        guide for Theology students.

    <p>
        Structure for a Summa project: A general question, <br/>
        an article (topic), two or three objections to the <br/>
        author's own statement, "on the contrary" which cites <br/>
        words or works of an expert in this area to support <br/>
        the author's own opinion, "I answer that" part which <br/>
        stats the author's own opinion, and the author's reply <br/>
        to all the previously stated objections.
    </p>
    <h3>About This Project</h3>
    <p>
        There are two articles: one is "Is sexual desire moral?" <br/>
        and the other is "Is sexual activity moral?". I will talk about<br/> 
        two objections for each article and state my own idea.<br/>
