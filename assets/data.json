The case for each specific patient, moreover, is also highly disparate from one another. It is even a mystery that whether a psychiatric professional can really examine if one is faking to be mentally ill while in fact he is healthy. How does such a highly underdeveloped area of study involved in the criminal-justice system of the United States? Should people who are mentally ill be exculpated? Even so, are psychiatric criminals really treated this way nowadays?</p>"
