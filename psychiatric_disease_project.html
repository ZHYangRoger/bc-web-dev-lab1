        <h3>Issue Discussed</h3>
        <p>
            The cause and mechanism of a psychiatric disease , also known as a 
            mental disorder, is far more complex than what most people think. 
            The case for each specific patient, moreover, is also highly disparate 
            from one another. It is even a mystery that whether a psychiatric 
            professional can really examine if one is faking to be mentally ill 
            while in fact he is healthy. How does such a highly underdeveloped 
            area of study involved in the criminal-justice system of the United 
            States? Should people who are mentally ill be exculpated? Even so, 
            are psychiatric criminals really treated this way nowadays?
