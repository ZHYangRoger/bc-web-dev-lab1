    <h3>Issue Discussed</h3>
    <p>
        The cause and mechanism of a psychiatric disease , also known as a <br/>
        mental disorder, is far more complex than what most people think. <br/>
        The case for each specific patient, moreover, is also highly disparate <br/>
        from one another. It is even a mystery that whether a psychiatric <br/>
        professional can really examine if one is faking to be mentally ill <br/>
        while in fact he is healthy. How does such a highly underdeveloped <br/>
        area of study involved in the criminal-justice system of the United <br/>
        States? Should people who are mentally ill be exculpated? Even so, <br/>
        are psychiatric criminals really treated this way nowadays?
